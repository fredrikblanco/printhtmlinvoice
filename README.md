printhtmlinvoice
================
The idea of this module is to make possible for the users to print the invoice from Magento backend in html format. 
That way is much easier to configure the layout of the invoices.

following the the same urls as stated on the layout config file of the module.

This module is completly for free and you can use it at your own risk.
